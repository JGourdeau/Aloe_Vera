# Aloe_Vera

## Overview: 

Aloe Vera is a VERY simple user interface to track the percieved values of 3 metrics tracked and calculated by Garmin fitness wearables. These metrics include: 

1. [Stress Level](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=WT9BmhjacO4ZpxbCc0EKn9)
2. [Body Battery](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/health-science/body-battery/)
3. [Sleep Quality](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/health/garmin-sleep-score-and-sleep-insights/)

The program will label the magnitude using the same paramaters and cutoffs as Garmin. 

Aloe Vera also allows for a user to rank their perception of a day on a scale of 1-5. 

All the data is stored on a csv in the same directory as the program itself and with each submission datetime stamped and can therefore be integrated and compared with the data from Garmin Connect.

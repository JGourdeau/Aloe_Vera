# Aloe_Vera

Aloe Vera (named after the plant with burn soothing properties) is a simple user interface to track the percieved values of 3 metrics tracked and calculated by Garmin fitness wearables. These metrics include: 

1. Stress Level
2. Body Battery
3. Sleep Quality 

The program will label the magnitude using the same paramaters and cutoffs as Garmin. 

Aloe Vera also allows for a user to rank their perception of a day on a scale of 1-5. 

All the data is stored on a csv in the same directory as the program itself and with each submission datetime stamped and can therefor be integrated and compared with the data from Garmin Connect.
